Working directory - all the files that you have in your project
Staging area - an area between the repo and the working directory. Here the snapshot of all the files are moved

Repo - actual storage area

git status --> untracked files that are in staging area nut not in repo yet.
It doesn't tell us about files in staging area wich are also in repo
